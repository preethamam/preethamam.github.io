excerpt: 'Current manual road condition assessment procedures are time consuming and laborious. On the other hand, state-of-the-art commercial data collection approaches are expensive although the data analysis tasks are not fully automated. Due to these limitations, a section of a road is assessed once a year or once every two years. Since insufficient inspection is an important contributor to the poor condition of roads, this study presents the development, evaluation, and field application of a novel, relatively inexpensive, vision-based sensor system employing commercially available off-the-shelf devices that can be mounted on several vehicles and hence collect data from a section of the road more often. In addition, an approach is proposed to interpret the data, and detect, quantify and localize defects autonomously. The proposed hardware-software package system is ideal to be used for crowdsourcing as a complement to the existing commercial road assessment vehicles and reduce the operation cost.'

Current manual road condition assessment procedures are time consuming and laborious. On the other hand, state-of-the-art commercial data collection approaches are expensive although the data analysis tasks are not fully automated. Due to these limitations, a section of a road is assessed once a year or once every two years. Since insufficient inspection is an important contributor to the poor condition of roads, this study presents the development, evaluation, and field application of a novel, relatively inexpensive, vision-based sensor system employing commercially available off-the-shelf devices that can be mounted on several vehicles and hence collect data from a section of the road more often. In addition, an approach is proposed to interpret the data, and detect, quantify and localize defects autonomously. The proposed hardware-software package system is ideal to be used for crowdsourcing as a complement to the existing commercial road assessment vehicles and reduce the operation cost.
