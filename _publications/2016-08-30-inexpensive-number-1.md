title: "Inexpensive Multimodal Sensor Fusion System for Autonomous Data Acquisition of Road Surface Conditions"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2016-08-30-inexpensive-number-1
excerpt: "This paper presents the development, evaluation, calibration, and field application of a novel, relatively inexpensive, vision-based sensor system employing commercially available off-the-shelf devices, for enabling the autonomous data acquisition of road surface conditions. Detailed evaluations and enhancements of a variety of technical approaches and algorithms for overcoming vision-based measurement distortions induced by the motion of the monitoring platform were conducted. It is shown that the proposed multi-sensor system, by capitalizing on powerful data-fusion approaches of the type developed in this paper, can provide a robust cost-effective road surface monitoring system with sufficient accuracy to satisfy typical maintenance needs, in regard to the detection, localization, and quantification of potholes and similar qualitative deterioration features where the measurements are acquired via a vehicle moving at normal speeds on typical city streets. The proposed system is ideal to be used for crowdsourcing where several vehicles would be equipped with this cost-effective system for more frequent data collection of road surfaces. Suggestions for future research needs to enhance the capabilities of the proposed system are included."
