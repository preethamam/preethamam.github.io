Creating image stitching datasets takes a lot of time and effort. During my Ph.D. days, I tried to compile datasets that were comprehensive to have `spherical`, `cylindrical` or `planar` and full view `360 x 180-degree` panoramas. These datasets posed a real challenge to the automatic stitching method. If all these datasets are stitched well, it definitely shows the robustness of your stitching method.

All these datasets are public! Some of them were from my Ph.D. studies (especially on cracks) and most of them were downloaded from the internet. I do not remember the individual names of the dataset providers. But I acknowledge their work and I am thankful to all of them! I hope you appreciate their efforts in making these datasets public to advance the research!

There are 150+ `panorama` or `image stitching/registration` datasets in total. Please note that this dataset compilation is more for the qualitative analysis of the image stitching problem. For quantitative analaysis, I recommend using [Quantitative Image Stitching Datasets](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset). If I come across any interesting and challenging datasets, I will expand this compilation.

All panorama datasets can be downloaded here [Download Dataset](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlFYM4jwmzqrtaBpxVMpJegvN9QVZw?e=UIaYug). The original [GitHub](https://github.com/preethamam/Image-Stitching-Datasets-Compilation-Collection) link.
